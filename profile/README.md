# Welcome to PhysiBoSS-Models !

We are a database of PhysiBoSS models, providing cross-platform pre-compiled models, easily accessible via a python API.

## How to submit a new model

Create a fork of the [template-model](https://github.com/PhysiBoSS-Models/template-model) repository, add your model as a sample-project, and then submit a pull request. For more details, visit the [template-model](https://github.com/PhysiBoSS-Models/template-model) repository.

## Available models

- Cancer invasion model: [Invasion-Ruscone](https://github.com/PhysiBoSS-Models/Invasion-Ruscone), submitted by [@marcorusc](https://www.github.com/marcorusc). The goal of this model is to study the different modes of cell migration and to predict means to block it by considering not only spatial information obtained from the agent-based simulation but also intracellular regulation obtained from the Boolean model.
- PhysiBoSS tutorial models: [PhysiBoSS-Tutorial](https://github.com/PhysiBoSS-Models/PhysiBoSS-Tutorial), submitted by [@vincent-noel](https://github.com/vincent-noel). This repository contains three examples of multiscale models: a modified version of a previously published model of cell fate decision processes in response to death receptor engagement and the effect of a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment on these decisions, a cell cycle model for investigating the consequences of genetic perturbations in signaling, and a simplified model of immune cell differentiation. 
- LNCaP Prostate model : [Montagud-Prostate](https://github.com/PhysiBoSS-Models/Montagud-Prostate), submitted by [@ArnauMontagud](https://github.com/ArnauMontagud). This model describes prostate adenocarcinoma cells. This was built from a healthy prostate model, personalized using data from the LNCaP cell line. A prior version of this model was used to simulate the drug response in prostate cell lines in Figures 6, 7 and 8 of the [PhysiBoSS 2.0 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-023-00314-4).
